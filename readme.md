#QuickDoc is an HTML template for me to create a quick document on the fly.
###It is meant as a replacement of using Microsoft Word for me, though it is in no way intended as a WYSIWYG document. In fact, it will be all code.
\*It is sort of like the HTML5 Boilerplate, but wayyyyy simpler because it's meant to be a document, where you can do basic layout and stuff, but not meant to be a website.

\**I guess it's similar to the idea of LaTex, but I'm too lazy to learn yet another language. I know HTML and CSS, so I will do that.

This is born out of my idea that every child growing up, instead of being taught how to use Word and Excel to create documents, should be taught how to use HTML and CSS (or Haml, Markdown and some other variant and SASS/ LESS) to create documents.
